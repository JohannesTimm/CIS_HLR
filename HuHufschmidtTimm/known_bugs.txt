Partdiff-par-hybrid:
*Number of Iterations are not correctly parsed from Commandline or interpreted. Stops at araound 5 Iterations. Does not work with Aborting by Precision either.
*There are no runs which could validate the Numerics for the Hybrid Case.
*On the Development Machine MPI_Funelled is not supported, testing only on cluster. :(
